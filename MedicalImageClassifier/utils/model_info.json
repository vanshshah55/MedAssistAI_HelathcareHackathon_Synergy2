They are characterized by their bilobed nucleus and large orange-red granules in the cytoplasm when stained. Elevated levels of eosinophils in the blood can indicate allergies, asthma, or parasitic infections."

These cells indicate early stages of granulocyte development, identifiable by their large size, oval or kidney-shaped nuclei, and the presence of granules in the cytoplasm.

They target bacteria and fungi through phagocytosis and the release of antimicrobial substances. Neutrophils have a multi-lobed nucleus and small, pale granules in the cytoplasm. Elevated neutrophil levels are often associated with bacterial infections."
